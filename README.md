# Valentine's Day Website

An interactive, animation-rich Valentine's Day website — a personal gift built with love.

## Features

- **Envelope Intro** — A glowing pink envelope with a heart seal and personalized name, surrounded by orbiting sparkles
- **Cherry Blossom Petals** — Delicate petals falling continuously across every scene
- **Love Letter** — Lines reveal one by one with highlighted romantic text
- **Interactive Flower Garden** — Click anywhere to plant flowers; 8 unique types (roses, tulips, daisies, sunflowers, lavender, cherry blossoms, lilies, and wildflowers) with varied heights, colors, and styles
- **The Big Question** — "Will you be my Valentine?" with Yes and No buttons (spoiler: both lead to celebration)
- **Confetti Celebration** — Bursts of confetti with a heartfelt message
- **Ambient Effects** — Mouse trail sparkles, floating particles, and a soft pulsing glow
